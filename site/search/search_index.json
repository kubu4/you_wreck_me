In addition, the lab-safety Slack channel will be used to communicate when individuals arrive in lab spaces, are actively using them, and when they leave. Safety and security in the lab during \u201cStay Home, Stay Healthy\u201d With reduced population density in academic buildings, we need to be extra vigilant about safety and security. If you are essential personnel and you will be working in a campus building, please: - Use the UW SafeZone app to notify campus police when you arrive and depart from the building and to request assistance if you need it (e.g., if you arrive to find an exterior door open, if there is an unfamiliar person in the building). - Request a Husky NightWalk escort if you have any concerns about your safety as you leave the building to get to your car. - Keep lab doors LOCKED AT ALL TIMES. - Keep any windows in lab doors COVERED so that people in the hallway cannot see into the lab. - If you would like to carry pepper spray for self-defense, please let Steven know. - Report suspicious activity to campus police - their non-emergency number is 206-685-UWPD (8973). - If you feel threatened in any way, CALL 911. Reporting COVID-19 Illness If your health provider has confirmed or suspects that you have COVID-19, notify the Employee Health Center: UW Seattle, Bothell, and Tacoma students, staff, faculty and other academic personnel should contact the UW Employee Health Center at emphlth@uw.edu or 206.685.1026. (https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-health-and-safety-resources). The UW will respond as described in https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/#health. If you hear about exposure, inform our lab via both: - Roberts lab email list - Roberts lab Slack group Personal hygiene and safety in the lab during \u201cStay Home, Stay Healthy\u201d Wash your hands often with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. If you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue, and immediately dispose of the tissue. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Cloth face coverings are required when indoors and when there are others present on site, and outdoors when 6\u2019 of distance cannot be maintained. Assume that shared spaces are contaminated and wash your hands before and after entering shared spaces. Avoid taking public transport when possible, and if using public transport, follow all public transport safety guidelines. Communicate when you will not be working. Individuals do not have to share private health information, but you do need to tell your supervisor and employees if you will not be working as you would under normal circumstances to ensure essential services are covered. Lab hygiene and safety during \u201cStay Home, Stay Healthy\u201d Lab benchtops should remain as uncluttered as possible to ensure that surfaces can be bleached thoroughly. Spray bottles of bleach or 70% ethanol, paper towels, and soap for handwashing are available in both FTR 209 and FTR 213 . Ethanol bottles are stored in the flammable cabinet in FTR 209 . IF YOU ARE RUNNING LOW ON ANY OF THESE SUPPLIES, PLEASE CONTACT STEVEN IMMEDIATELY. Disinfect all high touch surfaces in the lab (e.g., bench tops, chair arms, door handles, light switches, handles of frequently used drawers/cabinets; lab equipment like microscopes) daily with bleach or ethanol. Disinfecting computer equipment = removing the possible germs and virus on your keyboard, mouse, or trackpad. A typical and recommended disinfecting solution is lab grade alcohol. Apply cleaner/disinfectant to a clean paper towel. A few simple dabs directly on to the paper towel is fine; do not saturate. Using your finger against the paper towel, clean the keys, mouse, external surfaces of a laptop and other areas. Do NOT use cleaner/disinfectant on your screen. Most chemicals will actually destroy a screen. If screens are regularly touched and need to be disinfected, use iKlear. If there is more than one person in the lab temporarily for any unexpected reason, make sure that you configure your work spaces to allow for a 6 foot distance between people at all times. Personal protective equipment (e.g., lab coats, eye protection) are individually assigned (i.e., not communal) - PLEASE USE ONLY YOUR OWN LAB COAT AND SAFETY GLASSES WHEN DOING WORK THAT REQUIRES THEM. Please wear gloves at all times while in the lab, and dispose of your gloves every time you leave the lab. Mental health We are living in uncertain, chaotic, scary times, and that can make it hard to manage mental health. If you're having mental health issues, you are not alone and UW has resources to support you! Here is a list of mental health resources available to you as a member of the UW community. Please also know that you can reach out to Steven (360-362-3626; sr320@uw.edu) if you are struggling. I am not a counselor, but can help adjust your work assignments as needed and direct you to support resources.

We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. In our lab we: Recognize our differences as strengths Promote continuing education in diversity, equity, and inclusion. See non-exhaustive list of DEI resources offered by UW and beyond Provide educational and emotional support for each other Provide resources for educational and emotional support Provide resources for personal and professional growth Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. We do not tolerate harassment and/or discrimination of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions (however, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate). We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event. If you have experienced harassment, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Steven Roberts (SAFS Graduate Program Coordinator and PI) or Amy Fox (SAFS Graduate Program Adviser) immediately.

Inspiration for this has been provided by Tim Essington and Gordon Holtgrieve who have developed similar documentation. Data must be 1) adequately described via metadata, 2) managed for data quality, 3) backed up in a secure manner, and 4) archived in an easily reproducible format. Metadata All research data must be accompanied with a thorough description of that data from the beginning of the work. Metadata describes information about a dataset, such that a dataset can be understood, reused, and integrated with other datasets. Information described in a metadata record includes where the data were collected, who is responsible for the dataset, why the dataset was created, and how the data are organized. Data Quality Standards. Students must take care that protocols and methods are employed to ensure that data are properly collected, handled, processed, used, and maintained, and that this process is documented in the metadata. Backup and Storage Primary should be stored in several locations with canonical versions on Gannet (see below). Data, including intermediate analysis, needs to have a url. This most often means it will live on a Network Attached Storage Device (NAS; aka a server). Gannet is a Synology RS3618xs NAS : RS3618xs uses 16TB HDDs (n = 12) Data on Gannet is backed up in the following ways: Synology Hybrid RAID Mirrors data across HDDs, which reduces total storage capacity by 50% Allows for up to two concurrent HDD failures before data loss occurs Gannet/web folder One-way sync from Gannet to UW Google Drive via the Synology Cloud Sync app. Backup frequency: Daily Access: Public (read-only) Daily Data on Gannet Using the Gannet NAS to store your data: Ask Steven or Sam to generate a user account for you. A folder will be created for you in: gannet/web/ Ask Steven/Sam for the name of the folder, as well as your username and password. Upload data to your Gannet web folder: Navigate to http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/ Click on Web Browser login . If it's your first time visiting this page, your browser will present you with a warning about an insecure site or bad certificate. That's OK. Click on the option to add an exception for this site. Enter username and password. (NOTE: If it's your first time accessing your account, please change your password by clicking on the silhouette in the upper right corner, then \"Personal\" in the dropdown menu). Navigate to File Station > web > your_folder (If you don't see the File Station icon, click on the icon of four squares in the upper left corner and select File Station from the subsequent menu). Click-and-drag files from your computer to your gannet/web folder. Files that you have uploaded to your_folder are publicly viewable: http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/your_folder You can use the URLs for your files for linking in your notebook. IMPORTANT! All folders need to contain a readme file. The readme files should be plain text (i.e. do not create/edit the file with a word processor like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer) and should describe the contents of the folder. If there are directories in the same folder as your readme file, the directory names should be listed and a brief description of their contents should be provided. Please refrain from using any non alpha-numeric (including spaces) in file and folder names. NGS Data Management Plan Raw Data 1. As sequencing facility provides data, files are downloaded to our local NAS (owl), in the correct species subdirectory within nightingales . http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/ MD5 checksums are generated and compared to those supplied by the sequencing facility. Append the generated MD5 checksums to the checksums.md5 file. If that file does not yet exist, create it, and add the generated checksums to the new checksums.md5 file. The Nightingales Google Spreadsheet is updated. Each library (i.e. each sample with a unique sequencing barcode) is entered in its own row. SeqID is the base name of the sequencing file (i.e. no file extensions like \".fq.gz\" or \".gz\") Each library receives a unique, incremented Library_ID number. Each library receives a Library_name ; this may or may not be unique. Backup * The Google Docs spreadsheet Nightingales Google Spreadsheet is backed up on a regular basis? by downloading tab-delimited file and pushing to LabDocs Repository, with the file name Nightingales.tsv owl/nightingales is automatically backed up to two locations, both managed by Synology apps: Amazon Glacier: Backup task occurs weekly on Mondays at 00:00. CloudSync to UW Google Drive : Backup occurs in real-time any time new files, or changes to existing files, are detected. SRA Upload Sam will upload all high-throughput sequencing data to the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) . Once submitted, the BioProject accession and a link to the NCBI BioProject will be added to the SRA column in the Nightingales Google Spreadsheet . Proteomics Data Management Plan Raw Data 1) As sequencing facility provides data, files are downloaded to our local NAS (owl), in the root phainopepla directory. http://owl.fish.washington.edu/phainopepla/ These data are organized by species, then by mass spectrometer run date (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD). For each run date, all RAW files (including blanks, sample, and QC files) should be included in the directory with their original names. Inside of the YYYY-MM-DD directory there should be a Readme file with the following information : Description of each file (eg. treatment, blank, etc), experimental design, link to more information. 2) The Spreadsheet is then updated. Each \"mass spectrometer run date\" will be a new row in the sheet. Histology Data Management Plan 1) Before histology cassettes are sent off for processing, fill out the Histology-databank with all relevant information at the sample(tissue) level. Reserve space for blocks and slides by adding block-location and slide-location information. Each sample should have a unique-sample-ID which is: experiment-date_organism-label_tissue 2) After histology blocks are returned, photograph blocks and slides and label such that the location of each sample(tissue) can be readily understood. 3) Image each sample(tissue). Use the following convention for saving images: `[FULLTIMESTAMP]-[unique-sample-ID]-[magnification].jpeg e.g. 20180924-angasi013-10x.tif All images should be stored in the proper species directory at http://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/ Data Archiving The goal for data archiving is to make your research easily understandable and reproducible in the future. It is therefore incumbent upon the researcher that, by the end of a project, care and effort is given to providing a highly organized and traceable accounting of the research that is archived in perpetuity. At a minimum, this archive should include: raw and full processed data, complete metadata, all computer code, and any research products (manuscripts, published articles, figures, etc.). You will find that creating a usable data archive is much easier to do as you go, rather than waiting until the end of your project! Options include GitHub -> Zenodo. Figshare UW ResearchWorks Open Science Framework Easy file upload for Collaborators Finally, data will be most usable if it is as flexible as possible. So an excel spreadsheet with different information on different tabs is not very flexible. Much better to have a text file, with the data in \u201clong form\u201d. This means rather than have a ton of columns, have a ton of rows. see Broman KW, Woo KH. (2017) Data organization in spreadsheets.

Our intent is to maintain an open, welcoming, and communicative environment among all lab members. You are encouraged to approach any member of the lab with questions or issues related to science or otherwise. As the old idiom goes, \"there are no stupid questions\". It is okay to make mistakes, but it is not okay to hide your mistakes from others - addressing them and learning from them is how we grow as scientists. Similarly, if you disagree with lab members on any issue you are encouraged to challenge them directly. To foster the intended lab environment, everyone must follow the code of conduct . Lab members are also expected and encouraged to participate in trainings, committees, and self or group education to strive towards a more equitable, inclusive, and just lab and departmental community. Here is a non-exhaustive list of DEI resources available to you at UW and beyond https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/wiki/DEI-Resources . Additionally, all members of the lab meet ~2x per week to discuss project progress, diversity, equity, and inclusion issues, and to get help from others. Here is an example of our weekly meeting schedule. NOTE: To enable attendance, all meetings are either held in person with the option to call in virtually (via Zoom), or entirely virtually. You are expected to attend all lab meetings, within reason (but no need to ask permission to miss an occasional meeting). Science hour is optional, but highly encouraged! Biweekly Project Progress Lab Meetings (1 hour): All members discuss their activities since the last meeting, planned activities for the next two weeks, and to get help from lab members on project-related issues. Biweekly Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Meetings (1 hour): This biweekly meeting provides space to learn, discuss, and engage in initiatives that further lab members' understanding about the institutionalized oppression present in academia. Example activities include reading articles prior to the meeting to discuss, tackling action items to improve DEI in the lab and/or department. Weekly Science Hour (Fridays, 1:30-4:30 but join when you can): A casual meeting to hang out, and sometimes tackle science issues/questions with the \"hive mind\" - e.g. we spend time debugging a script, interpreting a statistical analysis, interpreting/providing feedback on figures, or discuss science concepts that require more time than is available during the biweekly lab meetings. Practice presentation meetings (occasionally): When members prepare a presentation for a conference or symposium (etc.), they are expected to give a practice presentation to the lab group. For a 15 minute presentation, we schedule at least 1hr to deliver it, then receive lots of feedback. This exercise is invaluable, and greatly improves presentations. Roberts Mentoring Approach My mentoring approach will be somewhat specific per person, however generally I view my role as providing you the resources to succeed in your educational experience. There will be regular lab meetings where we primarily address any challenges members might be having while reaching their goals. Goals are important and I will working with you in developing long-term goals, however you will need to develop monthly goals. You might not always achieve them, but this helps you stay focused. Beyond lab meetings we have established a number means of communication . Utmostly important as you get into research, is to communicate issues and challenges. I will work with you to address, though often we might find that the most effective solutions are resources outside of the lab. I will provide honest feedback in an effort to push you to be your best. This will include pushing you to consistently be stepping back to re-evaluate your work in a larger context, and consider areas of improvement. The predominantly white and cis/het, amongst other factors, community at SAFS may not meet everyone's needs. For this reason, you are encouraged to seek mentorship and community in the way that is best for you. Personnel Expectations Research Methods A lot of our research involves computational analysis of large, novel datasets. You will need to be competent in computing skills including basics of bash and R. A common task you should be able to accomplish is installing and running Blast on your own computer. You should also be familiar with Jupyter Notebooks. As might be evident, we using GitHub extensively and you will be using this to document code and data (and everything else). Electronic Open Lab Notebooks are also central to the lab. You will be required to document your activity in real time . This will include not only benchwork and computational work, but also reflections, questions, and monthly goals. Writing. Always be doing it. Do not wait until you have completed a project but rather write the methods as you carry them out (or preferably before). This goes hand in hand with the lab notebook. Document your work in a detail that you and a stranger can completely reproduce it in 5 years. Graduate Students Graduate school is not easy, and not for everyone. Graduate school will be very challenging, and for most, very rewarding. Graduate school is not a job where you check-in and check-out each day, but rather an educational endevour where you gain a deep understanding of a scientific area and complete your tenure by contributing a valuable research product, that substantially advances knowledge. Understanding this fact might help you deal with the challenges and frustrations you will face. There is a lot going on during your graduate education. Staying organized and not overwhelmed is key. In the same vein, time-management is key. There are several strategies for this. I suggest reading \"Getting Things Done\". Finding time outside of lab to recharge your mind and body is essential. Graduate students will complete a Graduate Research Plan that will be updated on a quarterly basis. Prospective graduate students interested in graduate school and joining the lab, please submit this form . Please feel free to contact current graduate students for more information. Undergraduate students I enjoy having the opportunity to provide motivated undergraduate students with a chance to gain hands-on lab experience and get a better understanding of an array of approaches that can be used to study aquatic organisms. I feel this is an important component of your education. Depending on your status (i.e. intern, work-study, course credit, capstone etc.) there will likely be specific details that will need to be discussed. Undergraduates must review and sign the Undergraduate Commitment Contract prior to starting in the lab. Postdocs Postdocs should complete an Individual Development Plan (e.g. https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/ ) that should be reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis.

If you're interested in something new, feel free to start it up, share it with the rest of the lab, and we'll kick the tires! An overarching philosophy on lab communication is inclusivity and leveraging the common wisdom. Further, the intent is that prior conversations and issues (hopefully resolved) can be found by others (and future you). To that end, email is often considered a last resort. A side benefit is this should reduce email anxiety and overload. Slack Our means of general communication in the lab is through Slack . This is in lieu of email, providing a simple means of archiving, searching, and easy user management. GitHub Issues A critical form of lab communication is via RobertsLab/resources GitHub Issues . This serves as a catch-all for problems, concerns, troubleshooting, purchasing, wish list, lab meeting topics, and other miscellaneous things that you might need help with (also for which the ideas/resolutions might be useful for the rest of the lab). Lab Meetings We generally have weekly lab meetings. These can be attended in person or remotely via video/audio chat. Steven will post link(s) for joining the chats in Slack and/or in the event on the Roberts Lab Google Calendar .","title":"Lab Communication"},{"location":"Lab-Communication/#slack","text":"Our means of general communication in the lab is through Slack .

Below is a compendium of best practices based on our experience and the particular research we do. This is intended for those in our lab group, however comments and suggestions are welcome . Lab Notebooks An online lab notebook is required of all lab members. Entries need to be organized by date and in reverse chronological order. Platforms The preferred platform is GitHub. See Laura's Notebook , Steven's Notebook , or Yaamini's Notebook . Guide to creating a notebook on GitHub: One way to approach is simply to to follow the instructions at https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now. This is what our Notebooks are forks of. To leverage the modifications Steven has made... 1) Fork his repository associated with his notebook: https://github.com/sr320/sr320.github.io. Screencast 2) Change the user name associated the repository name in the Settings. 3) Revise the config.xml file to include your own personal information 4) Alter line 49 of your_username.github.io/_layouts/default.html so clicking on \"admin\" link takes you to your _posts directory. 5) Go to Disqus to set up comments for your website. Pick a page name, ignore instructions on adding code to your site. Complete registration. 6) Go back to config.xml file and add your Disqus shortname. This will magically alter code so comments will show up for each posts. Note sometimes revisions take a few minutes to render on GitHub. \u2014- Other options include: - genefish.wordpress.com (ask Steven for an account). See Grace's Notebook Make sure it is reproducible Document in a fashion where someone could replicate your work. Document daily A record of your work should be published the day of activity. Yep, daily! Even if you feel like you did nothing, post something to describe what you did that day. Did you read some papers? Great! Make a post that lists the papers you read. Did you spend all day searching the web? Also great! Make a post about what you were searching for and how successful you were in finding what you wanted. Maintain backup Have a copy of your notebook in another location. This could be done in several ways. - composing in text editor and hosting on GitHub - using IFTTT to post/save entries elsewhere - run script (i.e. wget) to archive contents Periodically, you will be asked to show where your backup is and demonstrate that it is functional.
