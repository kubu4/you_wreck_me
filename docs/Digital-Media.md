Media including photos, videos and audio can really fall into two categories. In some instances they might fall under **data**. In that case treat them as such and follow [Data Management guidelines](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/wiki/Data-Management). Another category might be considered **candids**. 

Candid media should be place in this [Team Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B_Kednl1tNImYlBEVjJmX3JJLUU). If you need access please [submit an issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/new). This has been developed in order to populate social media platforms, grant reports, and otherwise share in the adventures in science.
