- List of organizations that are striving to bring more diversity to the outdoors.

     - The College of the Environment communities are often consisting of people who enjoy and spend time in nature. Gatekeeping “outdoorsy-ness” is a serious issue that often excludes women, people of color, lower income individuals, and more. This can often make it difficult to participate in casual conversations at work/school or after-work/weekend activities, which can create a feeling of exclusion from the community as a whole.
