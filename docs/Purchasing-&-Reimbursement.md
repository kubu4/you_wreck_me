# SAFS Purchasing

Here is the procedure for purchases. Generally, we are shifting to have SAFS admin staff handling purchasing as default (SAFS Purchasing Form).

### 1. Submit initial request in [`#purchasing` channel on Slack](https://genefish.slack.com/messages/CDPNUMPFC/).
  1. Provide link(s) to desired product(s)
      - University of Washington preferred vendors should always be given priority (i.e. don't default to buying from Amazon.com)
  2. Purchasing approval will be confirmed by Steven and he will provide the appropriate budget number & name to use

### 2. Fill and submit appropriate form(s).

##### There are three basic means by which to submit a purchase. They are listed in order (top to bottom) of preferred usage:
