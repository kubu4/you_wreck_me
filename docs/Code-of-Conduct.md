All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

In our lab we:

- Recognize our differences as strengths

- Promote continuing education in diversity, equity, and inclusion. See [non-exhaustive list of DEI resources offered by UW and beyond](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/wiki/DEI-Resources)

- Provide educational and emotional support for each other

- Provide resources for educational and emotional support

- Provide resources for personal and professional growth



Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

We do not tolerate harassment and/or discrimination of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions (however, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate).

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

If you have experienced harassment, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Steven Roberts  (SAFS Graduate Program Coordinator and PI) or Amy Fox (SAFS Graduate Program Adviser) immediately.
