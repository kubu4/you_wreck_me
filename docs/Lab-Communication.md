The core list is below, but we are always open to trying out new tools (e.g. Slack, Gitter). If you're interested in something new, feel free to start it up, share it with the rest of the lab, and we'll kick the tires!

An overarching philosophy on lab communication is inclusivity and leveraging the common wisdom. Further, the intent is that prior conversations and issues (hopefully resolved) can be found by others (and future you). To that end, email is often considered a last resort. A side benefit is this should reduce email anxiety and overload.

## Slack

Our means of general communication in the lab is through [Slack](https://genefish.slack.com). This is in lieu of email, providing a simple means of archiving, searching, and easy user management.


## GitHub Issues
A critical form of lab communication is via [RobertsLab/resources GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues). This serves as a catch-all for problems, concerns, troubleshooting, purchasing, wish list, lab meeting topics, and other miscellaneous things that you might need help with (also for which the ideas/resolutions might be useful for the rest of the lab).

## Lab Meetings
We generally have weekly lab meetings. These can be attended in person or remotely via video/audio chat. Steven will post link(s) for joining the chats in [Slack](https://genefish.slack.com) and/or in the event on the [Roberts Lab Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mrc305%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles).
