## Plan
This plan is currently maintained on the Lab GitHub Wiki and is also available via Slack and the SAFS SharePoint server, and [mirrored on Gdocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUBcdH3TZaXo-mOX_RXsrBZFwby0ctqShee4merHWPI/edit) It is updated by Roberts and any updates will also be circulated by email to the entire lab group. If the COVID situation changes, we may restrict access or expand access accordingly, designate new critical personnel or remove them, and thus will revise this document and recirculate.

No one is required to work in UW facilities; only do so if you feel comfortable doing so and meet essential personnel criteria. If you or someone else believes that the Health and Safety Plan is not being followed, notify Roberts immediately and remove yourself from the unsafe situation if able. Roberts will review the situation and adjust safety plan requirements and personnel designations accordingly.

## Space
Facilities include the labs FTR 209, FTR 213, and FTR 228, and conference space and offices in FTR 230, FTR 232, FTR 234, FTR 132, and FTR 134 (Appendix: Figures 1 & 2).  See also [University Requirements for Covid-19 Prevention in the Workplace](http://we.discover.uw.edu/Ma0R0r0zAt0jd00Wh0EH0I2)

## Personnel
Only people in “critical research positions” are allowed on campus for the duration of [Governor Inslee’s “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-25%20Coronovirus%20Stay%20Safe-Stay%20Healthy%20%28tmp%29%20%28002%29.pdf). Staff / students are not required to work on UW facilities. You have the option to opt-out.  For our group the list of critical research employees includes people who are conducting [“long-term experiments... for which a pause would cause undue harm and/or cost.”](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/24/research-update-on-stay-home-stay-healthy-directive/) These people include:

* Sam White

* Steven Roberts

* Shelly Trigg

* Yaamini Venkataraman

* Jackson Roberts

* Grace Crandall

* Ariana Huffmyer

* Crystal Simchick


As of June 30,  the folks listed above are fully willing to come to work. YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND AT ANY TIME. If at any point you feel unsafe or uncomfortable working on campus, tell Steven immediately and we will figure out.



## Daily Requirements

* You have completed the [EH&S COVID-19 Safety Training](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/covid-19-safety-training-back-workplace). Note that non-UW employees can complete the training material via https://forms.gle/JvsyXSFkvjX8oK8z8

## Scheduling

The lab calendar (https://d.pr/WYJr2i) will be used to schedule time and location of individuals. In addition, the lab-safety Slack channel will be used to communicate when individuals arrive in lab spaces, are actively using them, and when they leave.

## Safety and security in the lab during “Stay Home, Stay Healthy”

With reduced population density in academic buildings, we need to be extra vigilant about safety and security. If you are essential personnel and you will be working in a campus building, please:
- Use the [UW SafeZone app](http://police.uw.edu/services/safe-zone-app/) to notify campus police when you arrive and depart from the building and to request assistance if you need it (e.g., if you arrive to find an exterior door open, if there is an unfamiliar person in the building).
- Request a [Husky NightWalk](http://police.uw.edu/services/safetyescortservices/) escort if you have any concerns about your safety as you leave the building to get to your car.
- Keep lab doors LOCKED AT ALL TIMES.
- Keep any windows in lab doors COVERED so that people in the hallway cannot see into the lab.
- If you would like to carry pepper spray for self-defense, please let Steven know.
- Report suspicious activity to campus police - their non-emergency number is 206-685-UWPD (8973).
- If you feel threatened in any way, CALL 911.

## Reporting COVID-19 Illness
If your health provider has confirmed or suspects that you have COVID-19, notify the Employee Health Center: UW Seattle, Bothell, and Tacoma students, staff, faculty and other academic personnel should contact the UW Employee Health Center at emphlth@uw.edu or 206.685.1026. (https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-health-and-safety-resources).
The UW will respond as described in https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/#health. If you hear about exposure, inform our lab via both:
- Roberts lab email list
- Roberts lab Slack group

## Personal hygiene and safety in the lab during “Stay Home, Stay Healthy”

- Wash your hands often with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
- If you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue, and immediately dispose of the tissue.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
- Cloth face coverings are required when indoors and when there are others present on site, and outdoors when 6’ of distance cannot be maintained. Assume that shared spaces are contaminated and wash your hands before and after entering shared spaces.
- Avoid taking public transport when possible, and if using public transport, follow all public transport safety guidelines.
- Communicate when you will not be working. Individuals do not have to share private health information, but you do need to tell your supervisor and employees if you will not be working as you would under normal circumstances to ensure essential services are covered.


## Lab hygiene and safety during “Stay Home, Stay Healthy”

- Lab benchtops should remain as uncluttered as possible to ensure that surfaces can be bleached thoroughly.
- Spray bottles of bleach or 70% ethanol, paper towels, and soap for handwashing are available in both FTR 209 and FTR 213 . Ethanol bottles are stored in the flammable cabinet in FTR 209 . IF YOU ARE RUNNING LOW ON ANY OF THESE SUPPLIES, PLEASE CONTACT STEVEN IMMEDIATELY.
- Disinfect all high touch surfaces in the lab (e.g., bench tops, chair arms, door handles, light switches, handles of frequently used drawers/cabinets; lab equipment like microscopes) daily with bleach or ethanol.
- Disinfecting computer equipment = removing the possible germs and virus on your keyboard, mouse, or trackpad. A typical and recommended disinfecting solution is lab grade alcohol.
- Apply cleaner/disinfectant to a clean paper towel.  A few simple dabs directly on to the paper towel is fine; do not saturate.  Using your finger against the paper towel, clean the keys, mouse, external surfaces of a laptop and other areas.
- Do NOT use cleaner/disinfectant on your screen.  Most chemicals will actually destroy a screen.  If screens are regularly touched and need to be disinfected, use iKlear.
- If there is more than one person in the lab temporarily for any unexpected reason, make sure that you configure your work spaces to allow for a 6 foot distance between people at all times.
- Personal protective equipment (e.g., lab coats, eye protection) are individually assigned (i.e., not communal) - PLEASE USE ONLY YOUR OWN LAB COAT AND SAFETY GLASSES WHEN DOING WORK THAT REQUIRES THEM.
- Please wear gloves at all times while in the lab, and dispose of your gloves every time you leave the lab.



## Mental health

- We are living in uncertain, chaotic, scary times, and that can make it hard to manage mental health. If you're having mental health issues, you are not alone and UW has resources to support you!
- [Here](https://uwnetid.sharepoint.com/sites/safs/covid19/) is a list of mental health resources available to you as a member of the UW community.
- Please also know that you can reach out to Steven (360-362-3626;  sr320@uw.edu) if you are struggling. I am not a counselor, but can help adjust your work assignments as needed and direct you to support resources. Prioritize your health before anything else.
